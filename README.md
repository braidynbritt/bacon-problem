# bacon-problem
The bacon problem uses a BFS search to find the amount of actors/actresses it takes to reach someone knowing Kevin Bacon.

## How to Use  
Enter an actor or actress into the program. The program will then print out how many people it passed using BFS to reach Kevin Bacon
For Example: If someone types in Zachary Quinto, it would output that Zachary Quinto has a Bacon number of 2 and what movies they were in.
